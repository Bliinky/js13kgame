# js13kgame

Glitch or die trying

A simple game where you play a square trying to find its way out different levels. The problem is, it's almost always impossible without glitching (i.e. entering commands in the console).

## Dev

> npm install

> npm run dev

> open `dist/index.html` in browser

> open `src/unit-tests.html` in other tab and check all tests are good before commit

To add a new test, add a new spec file and export it in `src/mainSpec.js`. F5 in browser must show new tests.

## Build // Release // Deploy

> npm run build

> npm run release

Or simply

> npm run deploy
